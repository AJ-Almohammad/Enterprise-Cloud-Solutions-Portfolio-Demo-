# Machine Learning Pipeline Design

## MLOps Architecture

### Data Pipeline
- **Feature Store**: Centralized feature repository
- **Data Validation**: Great Expectations framework
- **Feature Engineering**: Automated feature generation
- **Data Versioning**: DVC for data version control

### Model Development
- **Experimentation**: MLflow for experiment tracking
- **Model Registry**: Centralized model repository  
- **Version Control**: Git-based model versioning
- **Collaboration**: Jupyter notebooks and shared environments

### Deployment Pipeline
- **Model Serving**: REST API and batch inference
- **A/B Testing**: Model performance comparison
- **Monitoring**: Model drift and performance tracking
- **Rollback**: Automated model rollback on issues

## Use Cases

### Recommendation Engine
- **Algorithm**: Collaborative filtering + content-based
- **Features**: User behavior, product attributes, context
- **Training**: Daily batch training on user interactions
- **Serving**: Real-time recommendations via API

### Price Optimization
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost regression
- **Features**: Competition pricing, demand patterns, seasonality
- **Training**: Weekly model retraining
- **Impact**: 15% revenue improvement through dynamic pricing

### Fraud Detection
- **Algorithm**: Anomaly detection with isolation forests
- **Features**: Transaction patterns, user behavior, device info
- **Training**: Continuous learning from labeled data
- **Serving**: Real-time scoring for transactions
