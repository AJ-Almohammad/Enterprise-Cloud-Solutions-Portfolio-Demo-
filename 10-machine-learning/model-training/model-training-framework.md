# Model Training Framework

## Training Infrastructure

### Compute Resources
- **AWS SageMaker**: Managed training jobs
- **Azure ML**: Scalable compute clusters  
- **Google AI Platform**: Distributed training
- **Kubernetes**: Custom training workloads

### Training Pipelines
```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_recommendation_model():
    # Load data
    data = pd.read_csv("s3://data-lake/features/user_interactions.csv")
    
    # Prepare features
    X = data.drop(["user_id", "purchased"], axis=1)
    y = data["purchased"]
    
    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    
    # Train model
    with mlflow.start_run():
        model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        # Evaluate
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        
        # Log metrics
        mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "recommendation_model")
        
    return model
Model Validation

Cross-validation: K-fold validation strategy
Holdout Testing: Time-based validation splits
Business Metrics: Revenue impact measurement
Fairness Testing: Bias detection and mitigation
